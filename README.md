# Wimbeldon-Results-Webpage
A webpage for querying the results of the 2013 Tennis Wimbeldon Tournament 

The Wimbeldon Results data are stored in an XML file.
An XSL stylesheet is used to transform this data into an HTML table.
The user can filter the results table based on various criteria such as 
the number of rounds played in a match or the name of a player in a match.
The filtering is done using Javascript which dynamically changes the HTML 
results table based on how the user wants to filter it.

The webpage can be viewed using Chrome, Firefox or Safari at - 
http://titan.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~slamel01/WimbledonResults.html

The Webpage can also be viewed by opening WimbeldonResults.html directly with Mozilla Firefox or Safari. 
Internet Explorer does not support the XSLTProcessor object so the webpage can not be viewed with it.
